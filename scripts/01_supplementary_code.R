# Description ------------------------------------------------------------------
# The code first sets up the environment with the required packages. It then
# loads the data and proceeds to perform three analysis:
#
# Part 1 estimates the effect of fuel subsidies on fuel consumption
# Part 2 estimates salience
# Part 3 estimates the price elasticity of demand for fuel
# 
# Part 4 then combines the output of each of these analysis to calculate the
# additional overfishing that would arise by a 1-peso change in market price
# vs a 1-peso change in price subsidy
